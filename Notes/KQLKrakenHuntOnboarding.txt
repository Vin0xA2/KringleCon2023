  Click the blue Train me for the case button to get familiar with KQL.
  Looking for files was created on a victim system? => FileCreationEvents table


Create a free at cluster at (https://dataexplorer.azure.com/freecluster). From "My cluster", go to Cluster details and copy the Cluster URI. Use the URI to log into kusto. Follow the "Onboarding" message to run the script to create the data tables in your free cluster and start the training.


Start a new tab under "Query" to get data from the newly created table. There is tab completion when typing the query yourself. Example:

  Employees
  | take 10


Employees is the table to get the data from. The pipe | indicates a start of a new query. The "take" operator explores rows in a table to understand the data structure better.


When entering multiple queries, separate each query with an empty line. Make sure to put your cursor on the query you want to run when clicking Run.

  Email
  | take 10 
  
  Employees
  | take 10 
  
  OutboundNetworkEvents
  | take 10


The "count" operator returns the number of rows in a table; there are 200.

  Employees
  | count


The "summarize" operator does the number crunching. Ex: add numbers, find averages, or count things. The following queries the Email table and limits results to recipients being santa_claus@santaworkshopgeeseislands.org. It then displays a count for each recipient+link combination.

  Email
  | where recipient == 'santa_claus@santaworkshopgeeseislands.org' 
  | summarize count() by recipient, link


The "where" operator filters the data like the above example. Use with == for exact match. Use with =~ for exact but case-insensitive match. Use with "has" for partial and case-insensitive match.

  Employees 
  | where name has "santa"

Use the "distinct" operator to find unique values.

  Email

  | distinct sender


Use "summarize dcount()" to get the count of unique values.

  Email 
  | where sender has "SantaWorkshopGeeseIslands.org" 
  | summarize dcount(sender)
