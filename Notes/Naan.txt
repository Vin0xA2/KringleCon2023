See Naan.jpg for initial message at startup and instructions. You have 5 cards and can type a number from 0 to 9. Each card has to be unique. The vulnerability is that you can type nan as a card as well. Playing a hand of 0, 1, nan, 8, 9 will call nan to be the max and the min, thus scoring you 2 points. Repeat 4 more times to get 10 points and complete the challenge.
