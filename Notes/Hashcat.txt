In-game terminal (on Island of Misfit Toys: Scaredy Kite Heights, follow the path northeast of the dock to about the middle of the island)
Objective: Determine the hash type in hash.txt and do a wordlist password cracking with hashcat.


(Initial message at startup)
In a realm of bytes and digital cheer,  
The festive season brings a challenge near.  
Santa's code has twists that may enthrall,  
It's up to you to decode them all.

Hidden deep in the snow is a kerberos token,  
Its type and form, in whispers, spoken.  
From reindeers' leaps to the elfish toast,  
Might the secret be in an ASREP roast?

`hashcat`, your reindeer, so spry and true,  
Will leap through hashes, bringing answers to you.  
But heed this advice to temper your pace,  
`-w 1 -u 1 --kernel-accel 1 --kernel-loops 1`, just in case.

For within this quest, speed isn't the key,  
Patience and thought will set the answers free.  
So include these flags, let your command be slow,  
And watch as the right solutions begin to show.

For hints on the hash, when you feel quite adrift,  
This festive link, your spirits, will lift:  
https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes

And when in doubt of `hashcat`'s might,  
The CLI docs will guide you right:  
https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=hashcat

Once you've cracked it, with joy and glee so raw,  
Run /bin/runtoanswer, without a flaw.  
Submit the password for Alabaster Snowball,  
Only then can you claim the prize, the best of all.

So light up your terminal, with commands so grand,  
Crack the code, with `hashcat` in hand!  
Merry Cracking to each, by the pixelated moon's light,  
May your hashes be merry, and your codes so right!

* Determine the hash type in hash.txt and perform a wordlist cracking attempt to find which password is correct and submit it to /bin/runtoanswer .*


(Read hash.txt)
~$ cat hash.txt 
  $krb5asrep$23$alabaster_snowball@XMAS.LOCAL:22865a2bceea...


(Google searching $krb5asrep shows it's AS-REP. Find the associated -m value.)
~$ hashcat -h | grep AS\-REP
  18200 | Kerberos 5 AS-REP etype 23 | Network Protocols


(See what the wordlist is named.)
~$ ls -al

(Run hashcat against the hash file. Also limit computing resources.)
~$ hashcat -a 0 -m 18200 -w 1 -u 1 --kernel-accel 1 --kernel-loops 1 --force hash.txt password_list.txt

~$ /bin/runtoanswer IluvC4ndyC4nes!
Your answer: IluvC4ndyC4nes!

Checking....
Your answer is correct!
