  The North Pole 🎁 Present Maker:
  All the presents on this system have been stolen by trolls. Capture trolls by following instructions here and 🎁's will appear in the green bar below. Run the command "hintme" to receive a hint.


(Type "yes" without quotes to begin.)
  yes


Perform a directory listing of your home directory to find a troll and retrieve a present!
~$ ls
  HELP  troll_19315479765589239  workshop


Now find the troll inside the troll.
~$ grep troll troll*
  troll_24187022596776786


Great, now remove the troll in your home directory.
~$ rm troll*


Print the present working directory using a command.
~$ pwd
  /home/elf


Good job but it looks like another troll hid itself in your home directory. Find the hidden troll!
~$ ls -al

Excellent, now find the troll in your command history.
~$ grep troll .bash_history
  echo troll_9394554126440791


Find the troll in your environment variables.
~$ env | grep troll
  z_TROLL=troll_20249649541603754


Next, head into the workshop.
~$ cd workshop/


A troll is hiding in one of the workshop toolboxes. Use "grep" while ignoring case to find which toolbox the troll is in.
~$ grep -i troll *
  toolbox_191.txt:tRoLl.4056180441832623


A troll is blocking the present_engine from starting. Run the present_engine binary to retrieve this troll.
~$ ls -al | grep present
  -r--r--r-- 1 elf elf 4990336 Dec  2 22:19 present_engine
~$ chmod 755 present_engine
~$ ./present_engine
  troll.898906189498077


Trolls have blown the fuses in /home/elf/workshop/electrical. cd into electrical and rename blown_fuse0 to fuse0.
~$ cd electrical/; mv blown_fuse0 fuse0


Now, make a symbolic link (symlink) named fuse1 that points to fuse0
~$ ln -s fuse0 fuse1


Make a copy of fuse1 named fuse2.
~$ cp fuse1 fuse2


We need to make sure trolls don't come back. Add the characters "TROLL_REPELLENT" into the file fuse2.
~$ echo "TROLL_REPELLENT" >> fuse2


Find the troll somewhere in /opt/troll_den.
~$ find /opt/troll_den/ -iname troll* 2>/dev/null
  /opt/troll_den/
  /opt/troll_den/apps/showcase/src/main/resources/tRoLl.6253159819943018


Find the file somewhere in /opt/troll_den that is owned by the user troll.
~$ find /opt/troll_den/ -user troll 2>/dev/null
  /opt/troll_den/apps/showcase/src/main/resources/template/ajaxErrorContainers/tr0LL_9528909612014411


Find the file created by trolls that is greater than 108 kilobytes and less than 110 kilobytes located somewhere in /opt/troll_den.
~$ find /opt/troll_den/ -size +108k -size -110k 2>/dev/null
  /opt/troll_den/plugins/portlet-mocks/src/test/java/org/apache/t_r_o_l_l_2579728047101724


List running processes to find another troll.
~$ ps -e

The 14516_troll process is listening on a TCP port. Use a command to have the only listening port display to the screen.
~$ netstat -napt
