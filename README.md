Below are my notes and solutions for the 2023 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge (KringleCon). This is incomplete as I am still working on all of the challenges. The ones that stood out so far are the KQL Kraken Hunt and Certificate SSHenanigans challenges. The former I used KQL to query various logs to follow an attacker's movement in a breached environment. The latter I exploited vulnerabillities in a web application to gain privileged access. In both challenges, I see how attackers can gain access to an environment and move to their ultimate goal. I will upload more notes as I continue to solve these challenges.
